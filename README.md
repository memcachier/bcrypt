# BCrypt Readme

brypt is a go package that provides bcrypt password hashing
functions for Go. It does this by wrapping an existing C
implementation of bcrypt and providing a thread-safe Go binding to it.

## Interface (API)

~~~~ {.go}
func Crypt(plain string, salt BcryptSalt) (hashed string, err error)
func Verify(plain string, hashed string) (match bool, err error)
func GenSalt(cost uint) (salt BcryptSalt, err error)
type BcryptSalt string
~~~~

## Why BCrypt?

The advantage of bcrypt for password hashing over other algorithms is
that bcrypt is designed to be slow and for the slowness to be a
fundamental and controllable part of the algorithm. This is a
desirable feature as computers are continually getting faster, that
makes brute-force attacks more viable over time as more passwords can
be tried per second. Bcrypt is future proof as you simply give it a
larger work factor, which makes it slower.
